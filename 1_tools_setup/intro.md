# Intro Survey

Welcome to DSAI 5810/6810. To help me get to know you better and your background please fill out the following survey. 
There are no wrong answers here and your honesty/candor will 
help me know where to focus at the course level and also at an individual level.

Please edit this document directly (as a markdown file) and push to GitHub. Answers don't need to be long; yes/no or a short sentence is fine.


### Basic Intro

Name: Nicholas Brimhall

Undergraduate Degree (completed or working towards): BS Mathematics, Statistics (est. May 2026)

Graduate Degree (if applicable):

Why you are interested in this course?: I figured I might as well take one data science/programming course this semester, since all of my other courses are proof-based mathematics classes.

What do you like to do for fun?: Research; I work as a research assistant for the department, and I also have some personal side projects, including in machine learning and R programming.



### Knowledge Check

1. On a scale of 1-10 how much experience do you have coding in Python, 1 being no experience, 10 being world-class expert?
If you've coded in Python before what type of projects/work have you done?
   - Around 3-4. I have taken some introductory programming courses and a deep learning class where we used Python, but I am not nearly as comfortable with Python as I am with R or Java (I use R for most of my research and used Java in a two-semester CS course sequence).

2. Have you ever built an ML model before? If so, what type(s) of model(s)?
   - I build a model to detect rapids in images of rivers using a pretrained convolutional neural network, complete with a wrapper class, methods for adding a custom classifier head to the pretrained feature extraction layers, and configs for hyperparameters, as part of a collaboration with the USGS. I also built an LSTM model to convert time series of snow depth to snow water equivalent as a final project for an ML course. I also have some familiarity with more classical models (random forests, penalized regression, GLMs, GAMLSS) from coursework and/or research settings.

3. Do you have any experience in NLP?
   - One or two lectures and assignments from previous courses on sentiment analysis and bigrams for next-word prediction.

4. Have you had linear algebra and calculus before?
   - Yes, and I am taking proof-based courses in both subjects this semester.

5. Do you know how a neural network works?
   - Yes. I took a deep learning course last spring where we covered this in some depth.

6. Do you know what the transformer architecture is?
   - Yes.

7. Have you used AI and if so how have you used it? What models have you used?
   - If this question is asking have we used large language models, then yes. I use ChatGPT fairly often to get help with writing snippets of code for my research, especially in umfamiliar libraries. I have used Google Gemini when working on some projects using Google Cloud, where there is a built-in window for getting help, but I was less impressed.

8. How do you feel about the job market and getting a job after you graduate?
   - I am hoping to complete a PhD in statistics with a research focus in ML. I have no idea how that process is going to turn out, but if for some reason I was rejected from every program I apply to, I feel confident I could find a job. 

9. Do you know what tf-idf is?
   - No.

10. Do you know what an embedding is?
   - Yes. Embeddings map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional vector spaces, preserving some sort of closeness between elements that are similar in the high-dimensional data (which can be formalized by using topologies). 

11. Do you know what agentic AI is?
   - Yes. 

12. Do you know what RAG is?
   - Retrieval-augmented generation.

13. How important do you think AI is or will be in our society?
   - Predictive AI is already very important; where in the past classical statistical models might have been used, machine learning models (including both classical ML such as tree-based models and neural networks) are increasingly used whenever estimation or inference is required. I think that the importance of AI will continue to grow as LLMs and other generative AI architectures are integrated into society, and even further when someone makes an advancement in reinforcement learning/robotics analogous to the discovery of the transformer.

14. Anything specific you would like to learn in this course?
   - Anything is good.
