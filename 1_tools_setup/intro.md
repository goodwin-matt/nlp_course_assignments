### Knowledge Check

1. On a scale of 1-10 how much experience do you have coding in Python, 1 being no experience, 10 being world-class expert? If you've coded in Python before what type of projects/work have you done?  
I’d rate my Python experience around 6–7; I’ve worked on deep learning projects and some Bitcoin-related projects.

2. Have you ever built an ML model before? If so, what type(s) of model(s)?  
I’ve built machine learning models including deep learning networks and Random Forests, applied to tasks such as stock market sector analysis and predictive modeling.

3. Do you have any experience in NLP?  
I don’t have formal experience in NLP yet, but I’m excited to learn and work on NLP projects in this course.

4. Have you had linear algebra and calculus before?  
Yes, I’ve taken both linear algebra and calculus before.

5. Do you know how a neural network works?  
Yes, I have a basic understanding of how neural networks work, including how layers, neurons, and activation functions process data to make predictions.

6. Do you know what the transformer architecture is?  
I have a basic understanding of the transformer architecture, including its use of attention mechanisms to process sequences of data in NLP tasks.

7. Have you used AI and if so how have you used it? What models have you used?  
Yes, I’ve used AI in machine learning projects, working with models such as deep learning networks and Random Forests for tasks like predictive modeling and stock market sector analysis.

8. How do you feel about the job market and getting a job after you graduate?  
I think there are good opportunities in the job market, but it can feel challenging because of the competition. I’m hopeful that building my skills in Python, machine learning, and NLP will help me stand out and secure a strong position after graduation.

9. Do you know what tf-idf is?  
Yes, it measures how important a word is in a document relative to a set of documents.

10. Do you know what an embedding is?  
Yes, they are vector representations of words that capture their meaning for machine learning models.

11. Do you know what agentic AI is?  
Yes, I’ve read about agentic AI and understand it refers to AI that can make decisions and act autonomously to achieve goals.

12. Do you know what RAG is?  
Yes, it combines retrieval of information with generative models to produce more accurate responses.

13. How important do you think AI is or will be in our society?  
I think AI is and will continue to be very important in our society, but it can also be dangerous if not used responsibly. It has the potential to transform many areas like healthcare and business, but we need to be careful about ethical and safety issues.

14. Anything specific you would like to learn in this course?  
I’d like to get hands-on experience building NLP models, understand how transformers and embeddings work, and learn how to apply NLP techniques to real-world text.
