# Intro Survey

Welcome to DSAI 5810/6810. To help me get to know you better and your background please fill out the following survey. 
There are no wrong answers here and your honesty/candor will 
help me know where to focus at the course level and also at an individual level.

Please edit this document directly (as a markdown file) and push to GitHub. Answers don't need to be long; yes/no or a short sentence is fine.


### Basic Intro

Name: 
    Nathan Wilson 

Undergraduate Degree (completed or working towards): 
    BS Computer Science, Spring 2025 

Graduate Degree (if applicable): 
    MCS Computer Science, Graduation expected Spring 2026

Why you are interested in this course?: 
    I am focusing on Data Science and AI related topics as a part of my Masters degree. This course works perfectly for me in its goals to help me learn and create tools that are directly applicable to industry. I hope to have a good basis in theory for many different AI Topics by the end of my degree and felt that this course would complement the theory nicely by helping me make the connection to real world problems. I look forward to learning from you!

What do you like to do for fun?:
    I am a nerd. I love to play video games and watch animated tv and film. I also love to play tennis and have been learning the piano lately, which has been great to help me take a break from all the screens I look at during the day. My wife has been trying to get me into hiking and other more outdoorsy activities, though she is much more enthusiastic about those types of things. Still, I do love clearing my headspace and touching some grass from time to time.




### Knowledge Check

1. On a scale of 1-10 how much experience do you have coding in Python, 1 being no experience, 10 being world-class expert?
If you've coded in Python before what type of projects/work have you done?
    I wouldn't dare to say I was a world-class expert, but I certainly have had plenty of experience because of my computer science background. I'd say I have a 7 level of experience from a software engineering background and that I feel confident in my ability to figure out most programming problems that will be expected of me. Though I am sure there will be some packages or techniques that I have never seen before, and I definitely still have plenty to learn about!

    The projects I have worked on in the past have included Scientific Computing problems involving the Numpy library, Random Forests, Dynamic Programming, and Time Series (ARIMA and SARIMA model training). I have also done plenty of projects related to Data Structures and Algorithms and Optimization.

2. Have you ever built an ML model before? If so, what type(s) of model(s)?
    I don't think so, unless those models that I mentioned in my work with Time Series Analysis count. 

3. Do you have any experience in NLP?
    No. 

4. Have you had linear algebra and calculus before?
    Yes, and have worked with those subjects plenty since!

5. Do you know how a neural network works?
    I am taking a class this semester where we are currently learning about it. So ask me again in a week or two, and hopefully the answer will be yes!

6. Do you know what the transformer architecture is?
    Not yet. Going to be doing an assignment this week on it.

7. Have you used AI and if so how have you used it? What models have you used?
    I started out trying out ChatGPT to be my tutor and programmer where it could be, and then moved over to Cursor for a bit to help me to program, and lately have used Copilot in my summer job for more programming and general questions. ChatGPT is still my go-to for an AI directed question that is not programming related. I don't know much about how AI works, just have had some experience using it as a tool!

8. How do you feel about the job market and getting a job after you graduate?
    Not stellar. I worry about my degree choice and staying relevant. The Comp Sci field feels very oversaturated to me and I never really got into it with stars in my eyes about big salaries and flexible work, but I have encountered many others who entered my field with those ideas in mind and that means lots and lots of competition. I feel like I really need to go the extra mile to stay relevant and push past the "vibe coding" to be an asset wherever I end up after school. I want to develop as many skills as possible and find one that I really excel in.

9. Do you know what tf-idf is?
    No.

10. Do you know what an embedding is?
    No.

11. Do you know what agentic AI is?
    No.

12. Do you know what RAG is?
    No.

13. How important do you think AI is or will be in our society?
    I don't think AI is going anywhere. Especially as a software engineer, refusal to use AI tools isn't really an option. I want to learn how to use these tools effectively and ethically wherever it makes sense to use them! It already feels like such a buzz word, but AI really is everywhere right now. Those that aren't yet using it are probably wondering or have at least considered if AI could be used to help them in their work.

14. Anything specific you would like to learn in this course?
    There is so much I don't know. The article we read the first week and then those knowledge check questions are teaching me that there's a lot to understand in the field! I hope to dig in as much as possible during my graduate degree, and by the end of it I hope to have some ideas of tools that I can use to do some good wherever I end up.
